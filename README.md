# Data-Analysis
fun random side-projects analyzing &amp; modeling data 

Currently, I'm working on a linear algebra model for water usage within the animal agriculture industry.  
I chose Python of its wide-ranging packages and, obviously, syntactical ease of use (we've all heard the "Python is basically just pseudo-code" joke before).  Unsurprisingly, Python has some handy matrix packages.  I originally used Numpy but then pivoted to Sympy for this project simply because Numpy made me grumpy when I needed to calculate solutions to homogenous matrix equations.

I'm open to playing with the higher capabilities of other languages when it comes to data analysis, such as R or Matlab, so I hope to populate this repo with some other exploration projects in the future.
