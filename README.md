# Data-Analysis
fun random side-projects analyzing &amp; modeling data 

Currently, I'm working on a linear algebra model for water usage within the animal agriculture industry.  
I chose Python because this is what I usually resort to based on Python's number of packages.  Unsurprisingly, python has some handy matrix packages (I used Sympy for this project).

I'm open to playing with the higher capabilities of other languages when it comes to data analysis, such as R or Matlab, so I hope to populate this repo with some other exploration projects in the future.
